            <p>For this project, my teammates and I designed an IoT product that would promote civil engagement and created a fictional kickstarter video demonstrating the features and interconnectedness the product has with the user and society at large. Thus, Trekko was born: a small, portable IoT device designed to attach onto wheelchairs in order to detect road conditions and accessibility.</p>
            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <img class = "img-responsive" id ="wheelchair-storyboard" src = "assets/images/IDS2 Iot/Concept Storyboard - Wheelchair.jpg" alt = "wheelchair storyboard">
            <p>After much brainstorming, we narrowed down our ideas to three main storyboards. All three storyboards deal with accessibility, as we felt like there was an opportunity for significantly improving the quality of life for a generally overlooked population while also implementing a civil engagement component. Two of the storyboards were focused on designing technology that would help visually impaired people detect faces and detect hazardous items while walking. Our last storyboard was focused on creating a smart wheelchair that would collect data on road conditions and thus inform wheelchair users on what roads were more accessible. After hearing feedback from multiple people, we decided to focus on the smart wheelchair option as it was something that we believed was unique and could genuinely address an important issue.</p>
            <h2>The Context</h2>
            <p>Our team, now named the fictional The Ability Lab, would partner up with Google Pittsburgh to use the data collected from our product to create a new Google Maps feature that could inform wheelchair users on what the most accessible paths to take are.</p>
            <h2>An Ecosystem of People, Organizations, and Devices</h2>
            <img class = "img-responsive" id = "trekko_eco_photo" src = "assets/images/IDS2 Iot/trekko-ecosystem.png" alt = "flow chart diagram of how Trekko fits with other organizations">
            <p>The product, named Trekko, would be a small device attached to the metal bars of a wheelchair and would contain multiple sensors that would collect data on road conditions. Trekko embodies crowdsourcing as a way to improve the transit quality for wheelchair users. Data collected by the device would not only be sent to Google to help create multiple routes with difficulty ratings, but also to the Pittsburgh government, local accessibility advocates and non-profits to help the city of Pittsburgh better understand what parts of the city need improvements in accessibility. The design of Trekko itself was inspired by various existing technologies, including Airpods and the Apple watch, and we especially wanted to make the product small, portable, and unassuming. </p>
            <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
            <p>The kickstarter video was created using iMovie, with a mixture of components from stock footage and our own footage, animations (Adobe After Effects), and 3D rendering. The Google Maps prototype seen in the video was created on Figma using screenshots of the real Google Maps app. We wanted to strike an inspirational and innovative tone in our video by highlighting how Trekko fit into the overall ecosystem between wheelchair users, the city of Pittsburgh, and our phones. Special thanks to Professor Patrick Carrington for allowing us to borrow a wheelchair for our video.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Through the creation of the fictional kickstarter video and ideation of our IoT product, I began to value how important IoT is to technologyâ€™s continuously evolving future with daily life and how these products can be used for a pro-social cause. Prior to the design of Trekko, I have never worked on designing a product meant for accessibility, and I found this field both challenging and rewarding.</p>
            <p>It was especially challenging for my team and I to flush out how Trekko would fit into an IoT network while simultaneously benefiting all actors involved. We spent a lot of time deciding whether we wanted to make our own app for Trekko, but then decided that pretending to work with Google for the purposes of the design of this product would make the most sense and create the most value for the users. Furthermore, because of the COVID-19 situation, we did not have the opportunity to film some scenes that would have required more coordination, and thus had to rely on stock footage as well as the footage that we had shot prior to social distancing measures. If my team and I had more time to delve deeper into this project, we could explore how we could apply similar crowdsourcing concepts to improve accessibility in other fields, much like one of our original storyboard ideas about helping those that are visually impaired. Furthermore, we would have wanted to interview a wheelchair user that experiences many of the problems Trekko is trying to solve first hand and understand how this product could even better serve its target audience.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, this project allowed me and my teammates to think creatively and explore how technology could be integrated into society while promoting citizens to become more aware of accessibility issues in their city.</p>
