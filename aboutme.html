        <p>Hello! My name is Lily Shan, and I am currently an Technology Consultant Associate at PwC. I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a double major in Business Administration and Human Computer Interaction. My passion is being able to bridge the gap in visual and verbal communication between users and organizations through design, technology, and analysis.</p>
        <p> In 2019, I was a UX/UI Design Research Assistant for CMU's HCI Institute, where I designed Frolic (available in ios), an app that enables young girls to be more active, along with a team of project managers, developers, fellow UX/UI designers, and illustrators using a human-centered approach – user-testing and play-testing the app’s features with our core audience. From that experience, I quickly realized the true significance of the growing field of HCI and how little the average consumer paid attention to such intricate details in the design of a product, yet how important UX/UI design was for the successful execution of Frolic. In Summer 2020, I worked as a Technology Consultant Intern at PricewaterhouseCoopers, where I completed a 2 week virtual digital upskilling experience due to COVID-19.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I love to draw, read, and travel! In particular, I love studying people and portraits. One of my favorite books is "Catch-22" by Joseph Heller, and I'm currently reading "Slaughterhouse-Five" by Kurt Vonnegut. In terms of travel, I've been to 27 US states and 7 countries outside of the US, and Southeast Asia and Greece are among the 2 places I would love to visit the most in the future. </p>
