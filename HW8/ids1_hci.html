            <div class = "project-content">
                <p>Throughout this project, I was able to expand upon my knowledge of gridding and prototyping within a greater and deeper context. Because I was only given a simple set of text and concept behind the website, I was able to focus most of my energy in exercising my creativity in design techniques. Through the exercises and discussions in class, I challenged myself to explore aspects of design that I was more uncomfortable using and learned how to take the grid seriously, while also allowing myself to be creative within the confines of the container I was given. </p>
                <h2>The First Attempt</h2>
                <img class = "img-responsive" id = "hci-iteration-1" src = "assets/images/IDS1 HCI Celebration/iteration1_hci.png" alt = "iteration 1 of prototype">
                <p>The site map above shows my first full iteration when tackling this project.</p>
                <p>It was difficult knowing where to start because there is so much one could potentially do, especially given how simple the domain and sample text was. Thus, I tried to explore what made sense to me, googled examples of different website layouts, and called upon what we had discussed about information architecture to help guide me. When creating the wireframe, I wanted to showcase the schedule in a more unique manner by using photos and a horizontal timeline. I chose to put in lots of space for photos because this method would be an easy way to create color and variety while also subliminally educating the reader on HCII. However, I felt like the schedule display was awkward and knew I could create a better overall layout that was less cluttered in my next iteration. Even though I was not satisfied with my wireframe, I continued with my design because I needed to develop a “bad”, warm-up design in order to have a jumping off point for more improved iterations.</p>
                <h2>A Change for the Simple</h2>
                <p>This design is the photo slideshow on the right side at the beginning of this webpage.</p>
                <p>In my next iteration, I wanted to massively simplify my design and focus more on the display of the actual context using typography, color and simple shapes instead of including photos in my design. The white background in my previous design felt too elementary, thus, I made the background black, stuck to the logo I had created previously, and stripped down the amount of information displayed on the home screen. Instead of the overly elaborate timeline, I simplified the schedule display into a vertically linear fashion. I continued with the black, white and red color scheme. Furthermore, I shortened the line lengths on the lecture titles and added red accents to the times in order to bring more color into my design. I also made each lecture title small caps in order to create a clearer hierarchy and added a faded, enlarged “25” to fill up some of the whitespace and add some interest in the background. Overall, from this iteration, I learned the value of whitespace. Oftentimes, when a design looks too empty I feel as if it is missing something and that I need to do something in order to fill up that space. However, once I simplified my wireframe and let the whitespace breathe, the design automatically looked much more nuanced.</p>
                <h2>Adding Back Some Flair</h2>
                <p>This design is the photo slideshow on the left side at the beginning of this webpage.</p>
                <p>For my last iteration, I wanted to create a design completely different than the other iterations I had made in the past. Furthermore, I wanted to challenge myself and use colors other than the few I was comfortable with. I played around with a few colors, but finally settled on two neutral brown shades and white, for a classic, yet comforting feel. Additionally, I chose a serif font for the main logo and wrote “25” in Roman numerals to emphasize the classic theme. In this iteration, I wanted to further challenge myself by using photos, another design component I am somewhat uncomfortable with, to once again continue with the classic theme due to the black and white nature of the photo and the traditional architecture of Margaret Morrison. I duplicated, reversed the photo, and explored varying levels of opacity, as well as used a sans serif font for the rest of the body text and headlines in order to modernize the design. In the other two web pages that illustrated the schedule, I wanted to hint at the split screen, two-toned effect that I had with the home page by splitting the page into two different colors, which would also assist the reader in separating different chunks of information. Furthermore, in order to tie together the black and white photograph element from the home page into other pages, I added a footer using the same Margaret Morrison photo and mirrored the same effect I did previously, but on a smaller scale. It was difficult to choose between this iteration and my previous, more modern iteration. After consulting classmates and friends, I decided upon this design because it was unique, yet simple, readable and had a hybrid style of classical and modern. </p>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>From this entire process, I learned the value in iterations, whitespace, and gridding. While these were all concepts I was familiar with before, I was able to explore them in a more in depth manner and consider them from different perspectives. In previous classes, I was given set instructions for how many iterations to make, which guided the iterative design process for me. In this assignment, because I was not given these specific instructions, I had to take initiative in creating multiple iterations, something that I had not considered initially because I was so focused on just getting the assignment done. The moment I paused and considered my potential if I branched out and created something new was the moment I made my favorite and final design, proving to me the rewarding nature of the iterative design process. Similarly, the moment I saw my designs within a greater context and explored on Google to see what other designers were creating for their webpages was the moment I realized the value in simplification, whitespace, and letting a design breathe. Furthermore, when I challenged myself to utilize the grid in a stricter manner, I found myself liking those designs more while also realizing that following the grid more closely did not necessarily mean I had to forsake my creativity. Overall, this prototyping process taught me that design, more than anything else, is about trying new ideas unabashedly and challenging oneself to be less comfortable.</p>
