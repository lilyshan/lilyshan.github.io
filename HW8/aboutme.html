      <p>Hello! My name is Lily Shan, and I am a current junior studying Business Administration and Human Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. My passion is being able to bridge the gap in visual and verbal communication between users and organizations through design, technology, and analysis. In Summer 2019, I worked as a Consumer Experience Analysis Intern at Hughes Network Systems, where I co-facilitated a series of user studies on one of the company's auxiliary products, a wifi booster. From that experience, I quickly realized the true significance of the growing field of HCI and how little the average consumer paid attention to such intricate details in the design of a product, yet how important UX/UI design was for the companyâ€™s reputation and customer relationship. Overall, I worked closely with my co-worker to gleam valuable information on the usability and desirability of the company's product while witnessing and partaking in the entire user research process. For this upcoming summer, I will be working as a Technical Consulting Intern at Pricewaterhouse Cooper.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I love to draw, read, and travel! In particular, I love studying people and portraits. One of my favorite books is "Catch-22" by Joseph Heller, and I'm currently reading "Slaughterhouse-Five" by Kurt Vonnegut. In terms of travel, I've been to 27 US states and 7 countries outside of the US, and Southeast Asia and Greece are among the 2 places I would love to visit the most in the future. </p>
