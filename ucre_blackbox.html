                    <p>For this project, we partnered with Kelly Strayhorn Theater, a local theater in Pittsburgh, to help them come up with an engaging, yet feasible new experience that allows them to create meaningful interactions with their community during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                    <p>Since COVID-19 has forced the Kelly Strayhorn Theater to shut down its physical spaces, they have had to quickly adapt to a virtual environment and overcome the challenges that come with this change. In looking at how to set KST apart in the hyper-competitive world of online content, our team kept returning to its incredible community as a potential differentiator. Thus, we asked ourselves: How might the Kelly Strayhorn Theater create an enhanced sense of community and togetherness within the limitations of a virtual environment?</p>
                    <p>Through various user research methods, we learned three things.</p> 
                    <ol>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">First, theatergoers love theater primarily because it provides a space for strengthening social relationships. It helps them find and build off common ground. Furthermore, socializing is a narrowly defined word.</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Theatergoers wanted to focus on experiences with friends and family only - no strangers.</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Finally, what people missed most from in-person theater was the “night out” experience – a time dedicated to enjoying good food and amazing art, capped off with quality time discussing the show.</li>
                    </ol>
                  
                <p>Thus, we want to bring the “night-out” experience into the homes of KST’s patrons with the KST Black Box Theater. Prior to live performances, friends can collectively purchase boxes to share the social experience from their individual homes. The boxes will include a snack, dessert, trivia card and cocktail ingredients from local East Liberty restaurants, and various performance memorabilia. Before the performance, a digital lobby will allow audience members to craft their chosen cocktail along with a bartender, before enjoying refreshments during a live stream of the performance. With our solution, KST will become a staple of patrons’ leisure activities. The novelty of the Black Box Theater events, opportunities to socialize with friends, and tie-ins to the beloved theater experience will help theatergoers overcome the monotony of traditional virtual content and prove that it is possible to bring theater into the home.</p>
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>How might KST create an enhanced sense of community and togetherness within the limitations of a virtual environment?</p>
                <p>KST’s financial and operational viability has been severely disrupted by COVID-19, forcing the theater to close down and driving problems in attendance and funding. Furthermore, theater is also now competing in the hyper-competitive world of online content, and KST’s limited budget means it will unlikely capture users’ attention with its content alone. Instead, what made KST successful before was building a tightly-knit community that was loyal to the theater’s content. This needed to be the focal point in reviving the theater.</p>
                
                <h2>The Methods</h2>
                <p>For a fully detailed report about our entire research process: <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vSZCZbrN4JkvNwrKrGoPHrFoc4YAPVTAF2XoFU1WjKs/edit?usp=sharing">Research Report</a></p>
                <br>
                <h4>Reverse Assumptions</h4>
                <p>After doing some initial background research regarding what the current state on theater is (apps, emerging technologies, business changes due to COVID, current virtual theater events, general statistics and insights) and analyzing data provided to us by Kelly Strayhorn theater in regards to their patrons and events, we decided to do a reverse assumptions activity in order to challenge our current perspective on how we could revive and revolutionize theater during the COVID pandemic. This was a great brainstorming activity that opened our minds for what could be possible as we moved forward with the research process.</p>
                <img class = "img-responsive" id = "reverse-assump-photo" src = "assets/images/UCRE Black Box Theater/reverse assumptions.png" alt = "">

                <br>
                <h4>Thinkaloud Interviews</h4>
                <p>Next, we conducted five thinkaloud interviews on the twitch.tv website, which is currently one of the most popular live streaming platforms. We chose twitch.tv to test with our participants because we wanted to see how current live streaming platforms operate in creating a loyal community for their entertainers. Furthermore, much like Reddit, Twitch is a site with niche, yet loyal fans, and we wanted to see how well its functionalities and features would be received by our participants, who are unfamiliar with the platform and are regular theater-goers. We believed that Twitch’s community building and facilitation was a large part of their success. Therefore, from these interviews, we wanted to see how we could apply those attributes to a potential solution for KST. </p>
                <p>Based on our participants’ feedback, we found ten major usability findings. Here are two that particularly stood out: </p>
                <img class = "img-responsive" id = "UFT2-photo" src = "assets/images/UCRE Black Box Theater/UFT 2.png" alt = "">
                <img class = "img-responsive" id = "UFT3-photo" src = "assets/images/UCRE Black Box Theater/UFT 3.png" alt = "">
                <p>Our main insights from these findings were: </p>
                <ol>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Users want focused and meaningful conversations that general chats can’t satisfy.</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Users want meaningful rewards and reciprocity from artists if they show support.</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Users want to have more visibility into the behind-the-scenes of theater production.</li>
                    </ol>
                <br>
                <h4>Contextual Inquiry Interviews</h4>
                <p>After analyzing what current platforms that are successful during COVID are doing, we then conducted five contextual inquiry interviews using a combination of artifact analysis and directed storytelling techniques in order for our participants to provide us context into their theater experiences. </p>
                <p>Our target persona that we wanted to interview was someone who had some previous background in theater and is an avid attendee of the performing arts (pre-COVID). We chose this persona because we wanted to understand how one’s past experiences in the performing arts would shape the way one consumed and engaged with theater shows. </p>
                <p>Using the information our participants provided to us, we created an affinity diagram to organize our participants’ thoughts in regards to their relationship with the performing arts and the larger community surrounding it. </p>
                <img class = "img-responsive" id = "affinityUCRE-photo" src = "assets/images/UCRE Black Box Theater/affinity diagram.png" alt = "">
                <p>To see the full affinity diagram in detail: <a href = "https://www.figma.com/file/Xt91YfFJbxK1Gk9Jx83wPn/Affinity-Diagram">Figma</a></p>

                <p>To summarize, we consolidated what we learned into six main insights:</p>
                <ol>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Theater is an inherently social activity</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">People use theater to introduce themselves to new, challenging perspectives</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Theater is a means to strengthen existing connections with friends and family</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">A good performance is immersive and escapive</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Theater can be a tool for experiential learning/exposure</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Frequent and intensive community involvement is rewarding</li>
                    </ol>
                <br>
                <h4>Storyboarding and Participant Feedback</h4>
                <p>In an effort to explore ways of improving Kelly Strayhorn Theater’s audience engagement in a virtual environment, our team used our previous insights and affinity diagram to rapidly generate ideas and identify user needs.  We then created 12 storyboards to address those user needs, and tested those storyboards by conducting the speed dating method with 4 participants. Speed dating is a type of interview method in which the interviewer will rapidly present a series of storyboards depicting a diversity of different ideas. The participant will then give their first impressions and general thoughts regarding each idea. </p>
                <p>These four storyboards were our participants’ favorite ideas:</p>
                <img class = "img-responsive" id = "storyboard2-photo" src = "assets/images/UCRE Black Box Theater/Storyboard 2.png" alt = "">
                <img class = "img-responsive" id = "storyboard4-photo" src = "assets/images/UCRE Black Box Theater/Storyboard 4.png" alt = "">
                <img class = "img-responsive" id = "storyboard7-photo" src = "assets/images/UCRE Black Box Theater/Storyboard 7.png" alt = "">
                <img class = "img-responsive" id = "storyboard9-photo" src = "assets/images/UCRE Black Box Theater/Storyboard 9.png" alt = "">
                <p>Based on the participant’s feedback, we found that:</p>
                <ol>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">The actual content of the show is often not as important as the group dynamic within the audience or the meaningful communication that surrounds the performance.</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">People want to interact with performances in a way that is in line with their comfort level, but that still feels earnest.</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Meeting new people is not as important as having an experience with an inner circle of friends.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>

                <h2>The Major Insights</h2>
                <ol>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Theater is about strengthening social ties; the performance is just the intermediary: Theater loses all value when it’s viewed individually. People want to use the theater to bond with friends, and share memorable moments together.</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Theatergoers want to socialize primarily with friends and family: Online relationship-building with strangers feels more like a chore than a perk. Social interaction needs to remain with theatergoers’ social bubbles.</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Theatergoers miss the experience of a “night out”: Online theatrical content can’t replace the excitement of co-experiencing a live event, complete with food, drinks, and post-performance discussion.</li>
                    </ol>
