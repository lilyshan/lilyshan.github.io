                    <p>For this project, we partnered with Kelly Strayhorn Theater, a local theater in Pittsburgh, to help them come up with an engaging, yet feasible solution in order to create meaningful interactions with their community during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                    <p>Since COVID-19 has forced the Kelly Strayhorn Theater to shut down its physical spaces, they have had to quickly adapt to a virtual environment and overcome the challenges that come with this change. In looking at how to set KST apart in the hyper-competitive world of online content, our team kept returning to its incredible community as a potential differentiator. Thus, we asked ourselves: How might the Kelly Strayhorn Theater create an enhanced sense of community and togetherness within the limitations of a virtual environment?</p>
                    <p>Through various user research methods, we learned three things.</p> 
                    <ol>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">First, theatergoers love theater primarily because it provides a space for strengthening social relationships. It helps them find and build off common ground. Furthermore, socializing is a narrowly defined word.</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Theatergoers wanted to focus on experiences with friends and family only - no strangers.</li>
                        <li class ="ordered-list">Finally, what people missed most from in-person theater was the “night out” experience – a time dedicated to enjoying good food and amazing art, capped off with quality time discussing the show.</li>
                    </ol>
                  
                <p>Thus, we want to bring the “night-out” experience into the homes of KST’s patrons with the KST Black Box Theater. Prior to live performances, friends can collectively purchase boxes to share the social experience from their individual homes. The boxes will include a snack, dessert, trivia card and cocktail ingredients from local East Liberty restaurants, and various performance memorabilia. Before the performance, a digital lobby will allow audience members to craft their chosen cocktail along with a bartender, before enjoying refreshments during a live stream of the performance. With our solution, KST will become a staple of patrons’ leisure activities. The novelty of the Black Box Theater events, opportunities to socialize with friends, and tie-ins to the beloved theater experience will help theatergoers overcome the monotony of traditional virtual content and prove that it is possible to bring theater into the home.</p>
